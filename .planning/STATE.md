# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-27)

**Core value:** Own your communication — your server, your data, your rules. Privacy through self-hosting and E2E encryption.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation & Deployment

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap creation: Derived 4 natural phases from 13 requirements (not imposed structure)
- P2P for 1:1 calls: Privacy, reduced server load (from PROJECT.md)
- E2E encryption for messages: Core value proposition (from PROJECT.md)
- Docker Compose deployment: Accessible to self-hosters (from PROJECT.md)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 (E2E Encryption):** Research flagged this phase for deeper investigation during planning. Custom E2EE protocol design using libsodium.js vs full Signal Protocol needs validation based on cryptographic complexity vs team expertise.

**General:** All phases marked as "TBD" for plan count — will be refined during plan-phase execution.
