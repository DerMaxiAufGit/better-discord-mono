# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-27)

**Core value:** Own your communication — your server, your data, your rules. Privacy through self-hosting and E2E encryption.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: E2E Encrypted Messaging

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (E2E Encrypted Messaging)
Plan: 02 of 06 (Frontend Crypto Library complete)
Status: **In progress**
Last activity: 2026-01-27 — Completed 02-02-PLAN.md

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33% (2/6 Phase 2 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 4.0 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.47 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-deployment | 5 | 21 min | 4.2 min |
| 02-e2e-encrypted-messaging | 2 | 7 min | 3.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03 (8 min), 01-04 (5 min), 01-05 (2 min), 02-01 (3 min), 02-02 (4 min)
- Trend: Crypto library work efficient, schema and crypto tasks averaging 3-4 min

| - | E2E encryption for messages | Core value proposition (from PROJECT.md) | In progress Phase 2 |
| - | Docker Compose deployment | Accessible to self-hosters (from PROJECT.md) | Completed in 01-01 |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 Complete:**
- ✅ All Phase 1 success criteria verified programmatically
- ✅ Complete documentation suite created
- ✅ End-to-end deployment tested and confirmed working
- Note: Backend npm dependencies have 2 high severity vulnerabilities (non-blocking, should run `npm audit fix` before Phase 2)

**Phase 2 (E2E Encryption):** Crypto library complete (02-02). Using libsodium.js with X25519 + XChaCha20-Poly1305, following Signal-style patterns without full Double Ratchet complexity. Next: server-side key endpoints (02-03).

**General:** All phases marked as "TBD" for plan count — will be refined during plan-phase execution.
